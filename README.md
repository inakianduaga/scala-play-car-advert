> Scala Play car advert example application

This is a small excercise app to demonstrate integration of a Restful service w/ AWS DynamoDB using the Play framework  

## Interacting with production app

Use the [Swagger UI official-hosted client](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=http://scala-play-car-advert.herokuapp.com/swagger/car/adverts/spec.yml) to test the Rest application in production. 

## Local Setup

The entire application is dockerized and can be run locally easily w/ minimal dependencies.

*Requirements*: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed

From the `./docker` folder
1. Build docker containers for dynamoDB and SBT by running `docker-compose build`
2. Spin up Play app & DynamoDB: `docker-compose up -d`. First run will take a while because SBT needs to populate the cache. App will be reachable on localhost:9000
3. API can be tested through the [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=http://localhost:9000/swagger/car/adverts/spec.yml). Local DynamoDB [provides a shell UI](http://localhost:8000/shell/) as well       

## Tests:

- [x] There are unit tests for the main Model classes / Storage service. 
- [x] Code coverage is generated automatically on Travis and sent to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/inakianduaga/scala-play-car-advert) for tracking changes / history
- [ ] Currently no integration test (those could be generated by using the Swagger auto-generated client)

## Deployment

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/inakianduaga/scala-play-car-advert/) is used for building and deploying the application on production (also runs tests on PR/Commit/Merges)

- [x] Tagged commits merged to master generate a [GitHub release](https://github.com/inakianduaga/scala-play-car-advert/releases) with the Scala jar
- [x] Production app runs on Heroku, with database running on AWS DynamoDB 

## Task Goals
 
Service should:

- [x]  have functionality to return list of all car adverts;
- [ ]  optional sorting by any field specified by query parameter, default sorting - by **id**; This was only partially implemented due to lack of time, currently sorts by id only
- [x] have functionality to return data for single car advert by id;
- [x] have functionality to add car advert;
- [x] have functionality to modify car advert by id;
- [x] have functionality to delete car advert by id;
- [x] have validation (see required fields and fields only for used cars);
- [x] accept and return data in JSON format
- [x] Service should be able to handle CORS requests from any domain.
- [x] do not use **GlobalSettings** or any globals like **Play.configuration** or **Play.application**, use dependency injection instead.
